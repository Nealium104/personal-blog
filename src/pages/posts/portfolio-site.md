# My First Blog Post

First Published on: 2022-03-10

Welcome to my _new blog_ about my first site! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished
    1. I've finished the Astro docs
    2. I've started documentating my process (practicing how to do documentation for code I write in the future!)
    3. I've officially escaped "tutorial hell" and am working on something I feel is both important, achievable, and REAL.

## What's next

Next, I need to decide on some solutions to the problems I know we're going to run into. (image hosting, dependencies, etc).
